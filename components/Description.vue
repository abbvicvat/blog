			<h1>  About The Blog </h1>
			<p>
				This blog will be (is) about different computer science concepts, mainly Graphs, Data Structures and Dynamic programming.
				I haven't posted anything yet, but most articles will (probably) be at a pretty basic level. If I feel like it I might post something more advanced, and interesting.

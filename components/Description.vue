		<h1>  About The Blog And Me </h1>
		<p>
			This blog will be (is) about different computer science concepts, mainly Graphs, Data Strucutres and Dynamic programming.
			I haven't posted anything yet, but most articles will (probably) be at a pretty basic level. If I feel like it I might post something more advanced, and interesting.
			Who am I? I am 16 years old and compete in informatic olympiads. I currently have a bronze medal in both BOI and IOI.
